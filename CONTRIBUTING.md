Thanks for your interest in aSlack! I really appreciate your taking the time to
make it better. The basics for code contribution are as follows:

 - Adhere to the [Python style guide]. [Pylint] checking is enabled to keep
   everything neat, and you can look at the existing code to see how things have
   been laid out
 - Any new functionality should be reasonably well covered with automated
   testing (I aim for 100% coverage, but this isn't a requirement for
   contribution - do cover the *"happy path"*, though).
 - Please [write a good commit message] when contributing.

## Issues

This project uses GitHub's issue tracker, feel free to open a new issue if you
find a problem in the current version. The more detail the better, though, and
do take the time to search for existing, similar issues.

Issues that are off the primary development track but would still be useful
functionality are tagged [Help Wanted]. These are a good place to start if you
haven't found a specific problem, but would like to help out. Please add a
comment if you start working on one of these, to avoid duplication of effort
(similarly, if you later stop working on it, do let everyone know).
